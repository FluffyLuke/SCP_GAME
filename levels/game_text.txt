STRANGE EARTHQUAKE SHAKES UP 
THE WHOLE FACILITY

At December 11, 2008, earthquake stroke the facility #18.
This is the third time this month, however until the most 
recent one they were minor and not dangerous. 
The third and most powerful earthquake damaged many parts 
of the building, including many contamination chambers.

"Damage was minor. The facility should be fully operational 
again by the end of January" - says the manager of
facility number 18, Dr. Clark.
When asked about the rumors, he said: "Nonsense. Noises 
coming from the vents are a result of the repairs. Any
personnel spreading such misinformation will be punished."
